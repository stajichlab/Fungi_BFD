# CLAUDE.md — Mycelium Living Repository

This repository is a **mycelium-enabled living repository**. It carries its own memory and grows smarter over time through structured traces of every action.

## Quick Orientation

1. **Read `.living/INDEX.md` first** — A one-screen knowledge map: tag clusters, most-recent entries, and a tag → entry-ID inverted index. Drill into the underlying file (`learnings.md`, `decisions.md`, `conventions.md`) only when a row matches your task. The SessionStart hook regenerates this index every fresh session — trust it.
2. **For targeted lookup:** `python3 skills/core/scripts/recall_lessons.py --living-dir .living/ --tag <tag>` — fetches only the matching entries instead of pulling the whole file. Also accepts `--id L-42`, `--since YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. **Read `ENVIRONMENTS_INSTALLATIONS.md`** — Environment setup, dependencies, and installation gotchas.
4. **Read the relevant manifest** — Each top-level directory has a descriptive manifest (`ANALYSIS_MANIFEST.md`, `DATA_MANIFEST.md`, `ALGORITHM_MANIFEST.md`, `REFERENCE_MANIFEST.md`).

## Installed Convention Packs

<!-- Updated by install_convention.py -->

### Core (auto-installed)

- **robust-analysis** — Defensive execution practices: strict error handling, data validation checks, parameter sensitivity sweeps, null hypothesis testing, adversarial self-challenge. See `.living/conventions/robust-analysis/analysis-conventions.md` for the entry point.
- **report-generator** — Structured LaTeX PDF report generation. See `.living/conventions/report-generator/analysis-conventions.md` for the workflow.
- **idea-generator** — Persona-based creative ideation for new analysis directions. See `.living/conventions/idea-generator/analysis-conventions.md` for the entry point.

### Domain (opt-in)

No domain conventions installed yet. Install with mycelium's `install-convention` mode (e.g., "install bioinformatics conventions").

## Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. **Open `.living/INDEX.md`** — its tag clusters and recent-entries lists tell you which past learnings/decisions are likely relevant. Don't skip this — it's already loaded into context by the SessionStart hook, but the agent should re-read for full detail when starting non-trivial work.
2. **Drill in selectively** — for entries that look relevant, either:
   - Fetch just the entries: `python3 skills/core/scripts/recall_lessons.py --living-dir .living/ --tag <tag>` or `--id L-42`
   - Read the whole file (`learnings.md`/`decisions.md`) only if you need broader context
3. Read the manifest for the area you'll be working in (e.g., `ANALYSIS_MANIFEST.md`)
4. Check `.living/conventions.md` for any repo-specific overrides
5. If a domain convention is active, read its conventions in `.living/conventions/[domain]/`

### While Working

- Follow analysis conventions: every analysis gets its own folder with UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.md documentation, scripts, outputs, reports
- Follow statistical conventions: report effect sizes, confidence intervals, document assumptions
- **Follow robust-analysis conventions** (`.living/conventions/robust-analysis/`): fail loudly on unexpected data, assert shapes/types/ranges, log row counts at every step, run sensitivity analyses for every decision, test null hypotheses via permutation/bootstrap
- **Do not subset data** without explicit user confirmation and justification
- Use marimo for exploration (start from `skills/core/templates/marimo-notebook-header.py`), Python scripts for reproducible pipelines
- Every analysis must have a `run.sh` or `run.py` that reproduces final outputs

### After Every Significant Action (Post-Action Hook Protocol)

**This is critical.** After completing any significant step:

1. **Update manifests**: Update the relevant manifest (`ANALYSIS_MANIFEST.md`, `DATA_MANIFEST.md`, etc.) with new/changed entries
2. **Update documentation**: Update or create the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.md file in the affected subfolder
3. **Log decisions**: If a non-obvious choice was made, append to `.living/decisions.md`
4. **Log learnings**: If something unexpected happened, append to `.living/learnings.md` (consider promoting to conventions if the pattern recurs 3+ times)
5. **Log findings**: If the work produced a scientific finding (empirical observation, validated/invalidated hypothesis, quantitative result, or domain discovery), crystallize it to `.living/findings/{topic}.md`. Check existing topics first for consistency. Prefer broad topic names. See `skills/core/templates/findings-entry.md` for format.
6. **Log todos**: If future work is identified, add items to `todo/TODO_REGISTRY.md` (create a detailed `todo/[item].md` writeup for complex items)
7. **Validate structure**: Run `validate_structure.py` to confirm repo structure is correct
8. **Crystallize conventions**: Review recent learnings — if 3+ entries share a pattern, promote to `.living/conventions.md` or a named convention pack
9. **Convention feedback**: Note whether convention pack practices were helpful or had gaps
10. **Session summary**: Write `.claude/last-session.md` with a brief summary of what was done, decisions made, and next steps

### Automated Enforcement

Mycelium hooks are auto-installed in `.claude/settings.local.json` during `init`:

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `mycelium-health.sh` | SessionStart | Checks `.living/` health, records session timestamp |
| `mycelium-post-action.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Detects code execution and directs Claude to run the full post-action protocol (debounced: one directive per work cycle) |
| `mycelium-stop-check.sh` | Stop | Safety net — blocks session end only if the post-action hook fired but `.living/` was never updated |

The PostToolUse hook ensures the protocol runs automatically after analysis/data/algorithm work. Read-only and config-only sessions are never interrupted.

### Knowledge Transfer (Cross-Project)

If this project is part of a multi-project portfolio (parent directory has `.living/`), the `mycelium-health.sh` hook checks daily whether cross-project knowledge transfer is due. When triggered, a background subagent scans recent learnings across sibling projects and automatically applies relevant transfers to this project's `.living/learnings.md`. Transfer entries are tagged with `(auto-transferred by mycelium)` for auditability. Audit reports are stored in the parent project's `.living/outputs/knowledge-transfers/`.

### Subagent-Driven Workflows

When using subagent-driven development (main context coordinates, subagents implement):
- Subagents receive a tiered post-action directive: Tier 1 (learnings, decisions, findings) fires for all contexts including subagents. Tier 2 (manifests, documentation, crystallization, session summary) is main-context only.
- After all subagent batches complete, dispatch a **crystallization subagent** to run Tier 2 steps and update `.living/`
- The Stop hook catches sessions where this step is forgotten

## Script Conventions

- **One-off scripts go in `scripts/one-off/`.** Any throwaway / single-purpose maintenance or fix-up script (data cleanup, cache resets, ad-hoc reports) belongs here, not in `scripts/`. Reserve `scripts/` for reusable, pipeline-supporting tooling. Default destructive scripts to dry-run and require an explicit `--apply` flag to make changes.
- **In Nextflow `.nf` files, audit every `$` inside a `"""..."""` `script:`/`shell:` block before shipping.** These blocks are Groovy GStrings — a bare `$` (e.g. `grep -v '^$'`, `awk '{print $1}'`, `"$HOME"`) is interpolated by Groovy, not passed to the shell, and can silently truncate/mangle the string instead of erroring at compile time. The failure only shows up at runtime as a broken `.command.sh` (e.g. `exit 123`, `unexpected EOF while looking for matching`). Escape any literal shell/regex `$` as `\$`, or better, do the logic in Groovy before the script string and interpolate the finished result so there's no `$` to escape at all. Full guidance: `~/.claude/skills/nextflow-hpcc/SKILL.md` (see "`$` inside a `script:` block is Groovy interpolation, not shell").
- **Never put `module load`/`conda activate`/raw `export PATH=` in a Nextflow process's `beforeScript` and assume it reaches `script:`/`stub:`.** On this HPC, `beforeScript` runs inside `nxf_main()` (a non-login `bash`), which then hands off to `nxf_launch()` → a brand-new `/bin/bash -l` login shell that eventually runs `.command.sh` (itself also `#!/bin/bash -l`). This cluster's login-shell startup chain (`/etc/profile` → user profile scripts) unconditionally reloads a **fixed baseline module list**, discarding anything loaded in `beforeScript` that isn't already part of that baseline — silently, with no error at the `beforeScript` stage, only a downstream "command not found" (or a wrong tool version) inside the actual command. Load any tool the `script:`/`stub:` body needs **inline, as the first line(s) of that same string**, right before first use — mirroring the existing working `export PATH="${projectDir}/bin:\$PATH"` pattern several modules already use inline. Verify with `bash -l -c 'echo $LOADEDMODULES'` to see the actual login-shell baseline before assuming a module survives. See `.living/learnings.md` (2026-07-31, "`beforeScript` module loads do not reliably survive...") for the full experimental trace.

## Data Conventions

- `data/raw/` is **IMMUTABLE** — never modify original files
- Every dataset has metadata in `data/metadata/[dataset-name]/`
- Every dataset has a manifest entry in `data/DATA_MANIFEST.md`
- Large files are gitignored with download instructions documented
